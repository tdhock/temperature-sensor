Does the McGill Bioinformatics office comply with 
[[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/phys_agents/thermal_comfort.html][Canada's guidelines for thermal confort for office work]]?

To answer that question I attached an [[https://abra-electronics.com/ics-semiconductors/linear-series/lm35dz-temperature-sensor-lm35dz.html][LM35 temperature sensor]] to an
[[https://abra-electronics.com/robotics-embedded-electronics/arduino-boards/ard-uno-arduino-uno-compatible-atmega16u2-board.html][Arduino]], which I [[file:LM35_temperature_sensor.ino][programmed to print temperature in degrees Celsius]]. I
[[file:log_temp_every_minute.sh][read data from the Arduino and write to a log file every minute]], and
get [[file:analysis/history/][historical outside temperatures in Montreal]] from [[http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d%3Ddata/history][Wunderground's
excellent web API]] ([[file:analysis/temperature.R][R script for downloading]]). I [[file:analysis/figure-timeseries.R][coded a
visualization of these temperature data]] using [[https://github.com/tdhock/animint][animint]].

*** TODOs

Measure humidity as well as temperature with [[https://abra-electronics.com/sensors/sensors-temperature-en/dht22-temperature-humidity-sensor.html][DHT22]].

First data viz on the web for discussion

It seems like the lab is hotter than the recommended maximum (23°C)
for most of the hours in a typical workday (9h-17h).

Haig's idea to compare with outside temperature (from wunderground.com
API).

*** 7 Dec 2015

Begin monitoring temperature every minute in the office. Canada's
[[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/phys_agents/thermal_comfort.html][Thermal confort for office work]].

*** 6 Dec 2015

[[file:log_temp_every_minute.sh]] records time and temp every minute.

Using https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile

Typing "make upload" then "make monitor" works! I touched the
temperature sensor and it went up from 21°C to 24°C. When I took my
hand off, it went back down!
