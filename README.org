Does the McGill Bioinformatics office (740 Dr Penfield, room 4200)
comply with [[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/phys_agents/thermal_comfort.html][Canada's guidelines for thermal confort for office work]]?

To answer that question I attached an [[https://abra-electronics.com/ics-semiconductors/linear-series/lm35dz-temperature-sensor-lm35dz.html][LM35 temperature sensor]] to an
[[https://abra-electronics.com/robotics-embedded-electronics/arduino-boards/ard-uno-arduino-uno-compatible-atmega16u2-board.html][Arduino]], which I [[file:LM35_temperature_sensor.ino][programmed to print temperature in degrees Celsius]]. I
[[file:log_temp_every_minute.sh][read data from the Arduino and write to a log file every minute]], and
get [[file:analysis/history/][historical outside temperatures in Montreal]] from [[http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d%3Ddata/history][Wunderground's
excellent web API]] ([[file:analysis/temperature.R][R script for downloading]]). I [[file:analysis/figure-timeseries.R][coded a
visualization of these temperature data]] using [[https://github.com/tdhock/animint][animint]].

Interactive data viz: http://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~thocking/figure-timeseries/

Raw data from sensor: [[file:time_degreesC.log]] (some minutes appear more
than once, since sometimes there was more than one instance of the
[[file:log_temp_every_minute.sh]] script running).

Cleaned data matrix from sensor: [[file:analysis/degreesC.csv]]. One row
for every day. 1441 columns, one for the day and one for every minute
(60 * 24 = 1440). Entries of the matrix are mean temperature in
degrees Celsius, or missing if there were no data recorded during that
minute.

Update to [[file:wikipedia.R]] in order to deal with new wikipedia table
format. Had to manually save after clicking "Show" -- need to automate
this step.

[[file:wikipedia.R]] makes the following figure, by downloading data from
wikipedia (not from my sensor).

[[file:analysis/figure-outliers.R]] plots the temperature at every minute
for some parts of the data where I suspect the measurements were
incorrect.

[[file:analysis/temperature.R]] now saves [[file:analysis/degreesC.csv]] which
is a matrix for every minute (currently only 5MB, compare with raw
data file [[file:time_degreesC.log]] which is currently 20MB).

#+BEGIN_SRC 
To all Staff:

We are entering a three- to four-week period, referred to as the
spring shoulder season, which runs from mid-April to mid-May. During
this period we switch from heating our buildings to cooling them.  As
this period is also highlighted by extreme temperature fluctuations in
the ambient environment, it is difficult for us to maintain stable
temperatures in our buildings.  The following factors further
complicate the matter:

• Most of our mechanical systems were not designed to respond to
  excessive temperature changes;

• Even though the mechanical ventilation is maintained throughout this
  period, most of our systems cannot heat and cool simultaneously;

• The transfer from one mode to the other is cumbersome and
  labor-intensive and requires a few weeks to complete across both
  campuses.

Once the heating system in your building is turned off, your work
environment may feel cool, especially in the early morning. This
situation will improve as outside temperatures increase. Should you
feel hot by mid-day, you can improve your situation by closing your
office blinds and avoid using other sources of heat such as
incandescent lighting. As this situation is only temporary, we ask
that you kindly refrain from using window air conditioning units at
this time.

If you require any assistance or should you wish to discuss any
situation of concern during this period, we invite you to contact the
Facilities Call Centre (FCC) 514-398-4555.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

- export data every hour (not minute) to data viz, to save disk space
  and allow posting on gist.
- color day off/work day.

First weekend data, show day of the week

The weekend appears to be cooler than weekdays.

First data viz on the web for discussion

It seems like the lab is hotter than the recommended maximum (23°C)
for most of the hours in a typical workday (9h-17h).

*** 10 Dec 2015

Haig's idea to compare with outside temperature (from wunderground.com
API).

*** 7 Dec 2015

Begin monitoring temperature every minute in the office. Canada's
[[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/phys_agents/thermal_comfort.html][Thermal confort for office work]].

*** 6 Dec 2015

[[file:log_temp_every_minute.sh]] records time and temp every minute.

*** 5 Dec 2015

Using https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile

Typing "make upload" then "make monitor" works! I touched the
temperature sensor and it went up from 21°C to 24°C. When I took my
hand off, it went back down!
